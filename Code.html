            In a city where nearly two-thirds of the population are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/nyregion/coronavirus-landlords-eviction-tenants.html#:~:text=There%20are%20about%205.4%20million,two%2Dthirds%20of%20the%20population.">renters</a>,
            many rent-related questions have risen. What happens if I can't pay rent? In such times it is important to know your rights.

          <h2 class="header">What if I Can't Pay Rent?</h2>
          <p class="text">There is currently a state-wide eviction moratorium in place. According to a state law called the Tenant Safe Harbor, if you have experienced financial hardship anytime on or after March 7, 2020, you cannot be evicted through January 1, 2021 for failing to pay rent.

However, the Tenant Safe Harbor Act does not cancel rent payments. Therefore, you still owe whatever rent payments you have not been able to pay.

          <h2 class="header"> What if I get COVID-19?</h2>
          <p class="text">Under no circumstances can your landlord  ask you to leave your apartment or discriminate against you because you have
            tested positive for COVID-19, or may be displaying symptoms, according to the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants. If you’re facing harassment by your
            landlord, report it to the City’s commission on human rights by filling out <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/about/report-discrimination.page">this form.</a>

          <h2 class="header"> What if my Landlord Serves me an Eviction Order? </h2>
          <p class="text">There is nothing that a landlord can legally do to evict you. In March, the city’s Department of Investigations (DOI)
             suspended all eviction proceedings until October.
            Therefore, if a marshal tries to execute an eviction warrant, report it to the DOI’s Bureau of City Marshals at 212-825-5953. </p>
